# sparta_ui_testing 
## Introduction
This set of work involves looking into automating data on a website also grabbing it and using it alongside rspec . Within this repo you will find examples of array, hash and json data usage and manipulation.
## Getting started
Simply clone the repository to your computer to get started with this rspec introduction. The rspec gem should be included with base Ruby. Checkout the rspec [documentation](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs/built-in-matchers) to brush up on general use of rspec.
### Prerequisites
This was done in Ruby 2.4.0 older versions may not be compatible.
see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38194032/how-to-update-ruby-version-2-0-0-to-the-latest-version-in-mac-osx-yosemite) for instructions on updating your Ruby version (on Mac)
Also you need selenium installed on your machine.
## Running Tests
In general run the following command in your terminal to get the results of your rspec tests.
```
rspec file_name.rb
```
Or if you just want to automate data without rspec just type this command
```
ruby file_name.rb
```
## Built With
Ruby and rspec and selenium!
